Motorola Google Nexus (QHD) - Index page Hello World missplaced (covers the link "Work"). Nav bar wrong on all pages
LG Google Nexus (Full HD) - nav bar looks wrong

mobile devices - About me skills table looks centered.

I just checked the first options in the lists. I could not find Microsoft Edge. After search the Cross Browser Tester returned "Device not found".

I tried to fix the header position on mobile devices, but I do not know how. I checked the approved examples, and they behave in a similar fashion. I have checked with "inspect" several websites with a fixed header hoping I could implement something in my code, but I did not manage to do so. On one forum I found something about a new class to be added called "fixed", which would be then styles in css, but that it would be introduced in a js file - and I don't know how to work with that yet.
